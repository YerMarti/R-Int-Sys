# R Script for Introducing Basic Concepts to Java Programmers
# Created by Onieva, E. & Carballedo, R.
# Revised using ChatGPT 3.5 and GitHub Copilot

# You can execute all the script using the "Source" button or pressing "Ctrl + Shift + S"
# You can execute a single line or a block of code using "Ctrl + Enter"
# In MacOs use "Cmd" instead of "Ctrl"

# Clearing the workspace and console
rm(list = ls()) # Clear Environment
cat("\014")     # Clear Console
graphics.off()  # Clear Plots

# Setting the working directory
setwd(dirname(rstudioapi::getActiveDocumentContext()$path))
# This command can give an error if "non-ASCII" characters are in the path.
# Is so, use the menu option "Sessions -> Set Working Directory-> To Source File Location"
